            <aside> <strong> Did you know... </strong> <br> Software development is a fast growing industry that is one of the highest paying jobs and does not even require a degree? 
                    In fact, most entry software developers started by just playing with code which led to certification; and that is all you need to get started!

                <h3 id="egg1"> What is software development? </h3>
                <p class="indent"> Software development is a more complex way of saying you work with computer software. Software is all the code and action behind the scenes of every computer. 
                    For example, software is what runs and displays your games, web browsers, smartphones, and medical devices. To break it down even more, you have specific software 
                    that runs applications, operating systems, and calculations. So, basically, as a software engineer you will be working with computers daily. <br>
                    Now that you have a basic understanding of what software is, lets get into the different types of specialties you can delve intoâ€¦<br>
                    Front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. 
                </p>

                <video id="movie" width="240" height="160" controls>

            </aside>

            <article>
                <h3> Front-end Developer </h3>
                <p class="indent"> A front-end developer focuses on the creation and maintenance of websites. 
                    Or, in other words, the part of the program the user sees. You will need to understand markup languages such as HTML and a basic understanding 
                    of other languages. Working with a web browser and debugging tests are also a necessity. Overall, your job will be working on what the user will 
                    see by maintaining it and keeping the speed as efficient as possible. </p>
            </article>

        </div>
        <!-- Div for back-end article -->
        <div>
            <article>
                <h3> Back-end Developer </h3>
                <p class="indent"> As a back-end developer, you will work with what goes on behind the scenes. Programming languages that you should know include Python, C, Java, and Rust. 
                    Understanding servers and how they run is also a skill that is required. In addition, having a basic understanding of front-end skills is essential. 
                    This is necessary because you will be working regularly with the front-end and you need to know how your back-end code will affect the output of the webpage. </p>

                <h3> Full-stack Developer </h3>
                <p class="indent"> Next, a full-stack developer is basically responsible for both the front and back-end of computer software. This requires knowledge in both programming languages 
                    and markup languages. Also, you will be working with servers, so you need an understanding of languages such as PHP and libraries like jQuery. <br>

                    and a display of the rough amount of knowledge required for each specialty.
